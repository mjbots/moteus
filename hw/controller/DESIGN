Build test fixture

r4.3
 * caps need switching to soft termination variant, C3216X7R1H106K160AE
 * caps need to be aligned parallel to board edge
 * I2C connector should be on top of board
 * Swap PA8/PB12 to improve ADC options
   * VBAT_SENSE goes to PB12, VTEMP_MOT goes to PA8
 * Need to rev board version pins
 * Update board rev number to 4.4


r4.2
 * A & C phase wires are *awfully* close to the gate drive terminals
   of their respective FETS.  Really easy to short them out when
   soldering, and would be easy to slide a bit further away

r4.2 DONE
 * Added 2k pullups to DRV8323 MISO and FAULT line
 * Added silk to DAC pin

r4.1 ERRATA
  * maybe don't need to fix...
    * the current sense lines are run to "slow" ADCs
    * current 1 and current 2 should be to ADC1 / ADC2
  * Could use an actual pullup resistor on DRV8323 MISO to get higher
    bitrates
  * Need actual pullup on FAULT line, 40k is too weak... Need
    something like 5k or smaller.
  * DAC pin has no silk screen labeling it

r4.1 DONE
  * Updated to correct STM32G4 pinout
  * Fixed SWCLK/SWDIO pins
  * Stopped using PC13/14/15 to drive LEDS
  * Moved encoder at least 8mm down the board to match fusion
  * Maybe get absolute encoder connector further down the board and/or
    further towards the center or maybe face down
  * Reroute power for uC
  * Reroute LED controls
  * Verified power connector polarity
  * Verified all alternate functions
  * Inspected all copper layers individually
  * Powered up r4 board with no stm32g4, nothing exploded and 3.3v
    power was there

r4.1 TODO

r4 DONE
 * all footprints in place minus new caps
 * switched TCAN334G to SOT23-8 variant for size

r3.1 ERRATA
 * Power input is labeled as +12V, when it should probably be +24V

r3.1 DONE
 * STM32F4 silkscreen had placement silk actually put on placement layer

r3 ERRATA
 * placement silkscreen for STM32F4 isn't on an exported layer

r3 DONE
 * Updated revision to r3
 * made all 220 ohm resistors be 0402
 * Extended length of ZH pins by 1mm
 * Switched all the 15/22uF caps to the X7R 10uF one
 * Re-arranged all silks
 * Verified that vert ZH connector fits on printout
 * Switched current sense to 0.500 milliohm from 1 milliohm

r2 ERRATA
 * footprint for 6pin ZH vertical doesn't have trailing pins long
   enough, needs to be about 1mm longer
 * have a 0603 and a 0402 220ohm resistor!
 * Output capacitors are 80% derated at 12V!  Need to select something
   that has a higher effective capacitance at the intended input
   voltage and put more of them on the board, at least 12 total from
   the current 6.
   *  Maybe CGA5L1X7R1V106K160AC which is 5.84uF at 12.5v?, 4.18uF at 18V
     * the r2 board has C3216X5R1V226M160AC which is 4.9uF at 12.5, 3.3uF at 18V
     * the r1 board has C3216X5R1V156M160AC which is 3.9uF at 12.5, 2.6uF at 18V

r2 DONE
 * ABS connector are now holes
 * SWD connector is vertical
 * debug switched to RS422 and vertical ZH connector
 * have silks give pinout of RS485 connector
 * add onboard FET temperature sensor
 * Debug pins
  * a DAC output
  * motor1
  * pins for addition serial port
  * CUR1 (amplified)
  * gnd
  * motor terminals
  * Added PC13,14,15 as HW version pins
